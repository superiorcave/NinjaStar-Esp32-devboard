# NinjaStar-Esp32-devboard
A custom created Esp32 devboard in the shape of a ninja star. This board also comes fitted with several classic images from the Anime.
Using an Esp32 Wroom, I was able to create a fun shape for the classic devboard and even insert my own custom images. Fitted with custom LEDS and buttons, 
this is great mircocontroller for any project.
